                    Who am I

                    So, as usual is hard to describe oneself.
                    As a presentation I would say I’m a nice, caring, happy and optimistic person (now).
                    
                    I work hard and laugh even harder, Love food and enjoy it the more than anything else in life. I’m trying to succeed living on my own and caring for myself 
                    as I give some of my time to try to relieve human pain alongside my Red Cross companions and friends.

                    I do my share of sports and exercise as I eat a lot, but I don’t want to damage my health.

                    I’m a Mechatronics Engineer and a soon to be Electronics Engineer too. I talk read and walk in English and, lets face it, I’m just learning to love life 
                    after a really though beginning.

                    So, come on with me, let’s see who I really am… It’s gonna be an interesting trip.

                    Job History

                    I do have it… But it doesn't look good in here yet so I'll add it later

                    Personal history

                     There is way too much I don't really want to share, not because I'm any how ashamed or I might be some sord of monster or anything like that. The thing is 
                     most wouldn't believe nor understand it, and yet they would dare judge me and even call me a liar (as it has happened before) wich is highly depressing, so, 
                     I'll just tell my normal, believable story, and here it is:

                     Borned in a regular, loving and caring family, second of three children. Both of my parents were teachers, chemistry teachers so education was kind of strict.
                     Also, my two brothers and I were kind of good friends,

                    Languages

                    (Just English, Sorry… not sorry). It is said English is the universal language, so my mother decided I had to learn it, also I already knew a bit about it, 
                    cause I love playing videogames, specially ROL ones such as Final Fantasy and similar ones, and I also love certain music (Rock, Hard Rock and old ballads) 
                    which is much more meaningful and nice in English. I dear to guess (not knowing at all) that’s why English was so easy for me to learn, you know it was just 
                    fun for me.

                    Anyway, I would love to learn other languages, I think it’s an awesome knowledge to have, and can never go wrong, specially if you wanna travel the world 
                    (and I do), so I hope I can start with German and keep going from there… Wish me luck.
