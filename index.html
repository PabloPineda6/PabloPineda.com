                                     <p style= "margin-top: 30px; text-align: justify">There is way too much I don't really want to share, not because I'm any how ashamed or I might be some sord of monster or anything like that. The thing is 
                                     most wouldn't believe nor understand it, and yet they would dare judge me and even call me a liar (as it has happened before) wich is highly depressing, so, 
                                     I'll just tell my normal, believable story, and here it is:</p>
                                     <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">Borned in a regular, loving and caring family, second of three children. Both of my parents were teachers, chemistry teachers so education was kind of strict.
                                     Also, my two brothers and I were kind of good friends.</p>
                                     <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">I was always a nice, loving and caring person, good at school and imaginative. I grew up wanting to be an odontologist until I got my brackets (that literally 
                                        killed that dream). So I started wanting to create robots, I studied Electrical and Mechatronics engineering to be able to do that (sad enough, robots where not 
                                        as artistic as I thought they would, at least not robotics as I have used them so far), so after long years working with hardware I got into a software related job 
                                        (as a software tester) and I found in software a long ago lost passion for front end programming is actually really artistic, so... Here I am now</p>

                                    <p style= "margin-top: 30px; text-align: justify">(Just English, Sorry… not sorry).</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">It is said English is the universal language, so my mother decided I had to learn it, also I already knew a bit about it, 
                                    cause I love playing videogames, specially ROL ones such as Final Fantasy and similar ones, and I also love certain music (Rock, Hard Rock and old ballads) 
                                    which is much more meaningful and nice in English. I dear to guess (not knowing at all) that’s why English was so easy for me to learn, you know it was just 
                                    fun for me.</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">Anyway, I would love to learn other languages, I think it’s an awesome knowledge to have, and can never go wrong, specially if you wanna travel the world 
                                    (and I do), so I hope I can start with German and keep going from there… Wish me luck.</p>

                                    <p style= "margin-top: 30px; text-align: justify">I have huge feelings for my family and friends. My family, bad or good job, made me most of what I am today, with them I learned to be humble, empathic,
                                    thankful, kind, I learned that being right doesn't mean it's fine to show off for feelings mean more than victories, I learned that to love is to let things go 
                                    so an old and honest mistake doesn't kill feelings.</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">For my friends I have the deepest feelings, for it's them who helped me love life and learn how to see things from other people's eyes. My family gave me life, 
                                    but was my friends who helped me learn to apreciate it, because life, sometimes can be a curse more than a present and is hard to but was my friends who helped 
                                    me learn to appreciate it, because life, sometimes can be a curse more than a present and is hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel. In those moments a 
                                    loving and caring hand can easily save a life... And even a soul.</p>

                                    <p style= "margin-top: 30px; text-align: justify">So, I used to be a deep thinker. Always wondering the why and how of things I couldn't comprehend. I used to wander through the city beating my mind with ideals, 
                                    hopes and dreams never to come true; let's be honest here, that was worthless and really stressful, but it did teach me a lot about myself and others and I'm not 
                                    ashamed to say I learned a lot from my own depression.</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">First, I learned nothing was given for free in life, you need to fight to the bitter end and never let go of the things you cherish, or they are gonna be taken away 
                                    from you.</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">Second, I learned, over anything you can get for yourself, never hurt others to get it, for nothing is worth shit if you hurt others for it.</p>
                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">Third and most important of all, smile, be happy, don't you ever let anyone take away who you are, for most will try and if they succeed, life will be a hell. Don't 
                                    you ever forget you are the one person who loves you the most, knows you the most, does anything for you and always forgives you, so you owe that person the very best 
                                    you can give him or her. This... This is my new philosophy of life, and trust me, it is worthy.</p>

                                    actually a great way to force me to interact with others, smile and give my best to achive a beautyful goal, hoping to give to others the care and love we all need.</p>

                                    <p style= "margin-top: 10px; text-align: justify">I don't eat for hunger nor for filling my body with energy, food is such a pleasure, such an experience, is almost as if it fills my soul with such divine touch. It's 
                                    basically the one thing that means more than anything else in life.</p>
